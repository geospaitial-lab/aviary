aviary provides composable components for building inference and postprocessing pipelines
for remote sensing data.
This enables you to easily run models on large datasets, export the predictions in a
georeferenced file format and postprocess them for further downstream tasks.<br />
Besides the pipelines, aviary also provides task-specific models for remote sensing applications.

aviary is designed upon the following concepts:

- **High-level Python API**<br />
  Abstract components for building pipelines without boilerplate code

- **Command-line interface (CLI)**<br />
  Run the pre-built pipelines easily without writing any code

- **Customizable pipelines**<br />
  Compose your own pipelines with the provided components

- **Extensible components**<br />
  Add your own components to the pipeline

- **Support for large datasets**<br />
  Tile-based processing for large datasets (local, remote or web services)

- **Support for geospatial data**<br />
  Export predictions as geodata, ready for downstream tasks

## Installation

You can choose between two installation methods, whether you need access to the Python API or
the command-line interface (CLI) only.
If you just want to use the pre-built pipelines with the command-line interface, you can use the Docker image.

### Installation with pip

```
pip install geospaitial-lab-aviary
```

Note that aviary requires Python 3.10 or later.

Have a look at the [installation guide](https://geospaitial-lab.github.io/aviary/how_to_guides/installation/how_to_install_aviary_with_pip)
for further information.

### Installation with Docker

```
docker pull ghcr.io/geospaitial-lab/aviary
```

Have a look at the [installation guide](https://geospaitial-lab.github.io/aviary/how_to_guides/installation/how_to_install_aviary_with_docker)
